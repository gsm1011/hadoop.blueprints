// The mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set
// of objects interact. It is a behavior pattern as it can alter a
// program's running behavior. 
// Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring
// to each other explicitly, and it let you vary their interaction
// independently.
