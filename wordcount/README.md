About
=====

This is the word count example using hadoop/mapreduce. 
The program accepts an input and generates output containing
the number of words in the input(s).

Dependency
==========

Hadoop must be deployed, either pseudo distributed or fully 
distributed. The the hadoop examples jar file should be avaiable
to run the teragen for generating the sample input. 

How to run
==========

The project is managed with Makefile, so, use generic make commands
to run this program. Specifically, use the following steps to run:
- Modify the environment variables in the Makefile.
- Generate sample random input data with teragen using "make geninput". 
- Run the program with command "make run"
- If you type the "make" command, the .java files will be compiled to 
  .class files and nothing else will be done.
